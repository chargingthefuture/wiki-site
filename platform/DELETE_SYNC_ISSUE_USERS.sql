-- ========================================
-- DELETE SYNC ISSUE USERS - PRODUCTION DATABASE
-- ========================================
-- This script completely deletes a single user and all their related data
-- from the production database. **No anonymization** - this is an
-- emergency force-delete for users that should never have existed.
--
-- USAGE (psql variables):
--   \set USER_ID 'user_36svITrJJgp5jY3qn25vXVviOXr'
--   \i platform/DELETE_SYNC_ISSUE_USERS.sql
--
-- Or via CLI:
--   psql "postgres://..." -v USER_ID=user_36svITrJJgp5jY3qn25vXVviOXr -f platform/DELETE_SYNC_ISSUE_USERS.sql
--
-- User to delete (set via USER_ID above):
-- 1. :'USER_ID'
--
-- WARNING: This is a destructive operation. Run in a transaction first
-- to verify, then commit if everything looks correct.
--
-- NOTE: This script is synchronized with platform/schema.sql and platform/shared/schema.ts.
-- When either schema.sql or schema.ts is updated, this script MUST be updated
-- to match all foreign key relationships so it can still successfully force-delete.

-- GentlePulse
-- Note: GentlePulse tables use a client-scoped identifier (client_id), not users.id,
-- so there is no account- or profile-linked user data to delete here.

-- Workforce Recruiter - Delete related data first
-- Meetup event signups: user_id references users.id directly (ON DELETE CASCADE, but explicit for clarity)

-- Finally, delete the user
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = :'USER_ID';

-- NOTE: Previously this script supported deleting a second user (:USER_ID_2)
-- in the same run. It has been simplified to a single :'USER_ID' because in
-- practice this script is almost always used for one erroneous account at a time.

-- VERIFICATION QUERIES
-- ========================================
-- Run these after deletion to verify:

-- Check if users are deleted
-- SELECT id, email FROM users WHERE id IN (:'USER_ID_1', :'USER_ID_2');

-- Check for any remaining references (should return 0 rows)
-- SELECT 'payments' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM payments WHERE user_id IN (:'USER_ID_1', :'USER_ID_2')
-- UNION ALL
-- SELECT 'admin_action_logs', COUNT(*) FROM admin_action_logs WHERE admin_id IN (:'USER_ID_1', :'USER_ID_2')
-- UNION ALL
-- SELECT 'support_match_profiles', COUNT(*) FROM support_match_profiles WHERE user_id IN (:'USER_ID_1', :'USER_ID_2')
