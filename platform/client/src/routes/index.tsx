/**
 * Main router component - combines all route groups
 * 
 * Note: Using fragments directly without Switch. wouter's Route components
 * work fine with fragments - Switch was causing the white screen issue.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: In wouter, when using fragments (not Switch), a Route without
 * a path matches everything and renders alongside other routes. To fix this,
 * we use a Route with a path that only matches when explicitly checking for
 * unmatched routes. However, since wouter evaluates routes independently in
 * fragments, we need to ensure the NotFound only renders when no other route matches.
 * 
 * The solution: Remove the catch-all Route and handle 404s within individual
 * route components, or use a more specific pattern that doesn't conflict.
 * For now, we'll use a pattern that matches but checks if it should render.
