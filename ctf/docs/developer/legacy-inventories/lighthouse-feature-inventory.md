# LightHouse Plugin Feature Inventory (Legacy Reference)

## Scope

- Source analyzed (reference-only): `platform/`
- Rewrite target: `ctf/`
- Plugin name to retain: `LightHouse`
- Guardrail honored: no edits in `platform/`

---

## Executive Summary

`LightHouse` is a housing coordination plugin for survivors and hosts. It includes:

- authenticated profile management for seekers and hosts,
- host property listing management,
- seeker-host matching lifecycle,
- authenticated announcements,
- admin operations for profiles/properties/matches/announcements,
- role and CSRF protections on sensitive writes.

This inventory captures implemented behavior in the legacy code and highlights migration gaps/ambiguities for ctf rewrite planning, including the currently unwired block model.

## 4) Data Model and Storage Behaviors

Evidence:

- `platform/shared/schema/lighthouse/index.ts`
- `platform/server/storage/plugins/lighthouse-storage.ts`
- `platform/schema.sql`

Core entities:

1. `lighthouse_profiles`
2. `lighthouse_properties`
3. `lighthouse_matches`
4. `lighthouse_announcements`
5. `lighthouse_blocks` (present in shared schema/storage interface)

Storage-level behaviors:

1. Stats aggregation for admin cards.
2. Match retrieval by seeker and by property context.
3. Announcement deactivate behavior uses soft-active toggle.
4. Profile deletion attempts cascade/anonymization logic for linked records.
5. Block operations exist in storage interface/implementation (`create/check/list/delete`).

---

## 5) Security and Policy Controls

Evidence:

- `platform/server/auth.ts`
- `platform/server/csrf.ts`
- `platform/server/routes/lighthouse/*.routes.ts`
- `platform/server/routes/index.ts`

Implemented controls:

1. Auth required across LightHouse route modules.
2. Admin-only gate for admin endpoints.
3. CSRF validation on admin writes.
4. Host ownership checks for property mutation routes.
5. Role checks for seeker-only and host-only match actions.

Observed note:

- No dedicated LightHouse-specific rate limiter/anti-scraping middleware is applied directly in LightHouse route modules.

---

## 6) Routing and UI Surface

Evidence:

- `platform/client/src/routes/plugin-routes.tsx`

Discovered app routes:

1. `/apps/lighthouse`
2. `/apps/lighthouse/profile`
3. `/apps/lighthouse/browse`
4. `/apps/lighthouse/property/new`
5. `/apps/lighthouse/property/edit/:id`
6. `/apps/lighthouse/property/:id`
7. `/apps/lighthouse/my-properties`
8. `/apps/lighthouse/matches`
9. `/apps/lighthouse/announcements`
10. `/apps/lighthouse/admin`
11. `/apps/lighthouse/admin/announcements`
12. `/apps/lighthouse/admin/profile/:id`

---

## 7) Test and Seed Coverage Signals

Evidence:

- `platform/test/api/lighthouse.test.ts`
- `platform/test/e2e/lighthouse.spec.ts`
- `platform/scripts/seedLighthouse.ts`

Observed:

1. API tests are largely request-shape assertions and do not strongly verify route/storage integration.
2. E2E coverage exists for profile/dashboard/property/browse/matches/admin paths but includes skip-heavy auth assumptions.
3. Some E2E selectors drift from current UI test IDs.
4. Seed script creates seekers/hosts/properties/matches/announcements and documents potential schema drift workarounds.

---

## 8) Gaps, Ambiguities, and Migration Risks

1. **Schema drift:**
   - `platform/shared/schema/lighthouse/index.ts` vs `platform/schema.sql` differ (e.g., nullable expectations and table coverage).
2. **Blocks surface mismatch:**
   - `lighthouse_blocks` exists in shared schema/storage but no LightHouse route/UI wiring was found.
   - Include as explicit rewrite decision/gap item (per user direction).
3. **Deletion behavior risk:**
   - Host-profile deletion path attempts anonymization for dependent records and may conflict with FK constraints.
4. **Test reliability mismatch:**
   - API tests are shallow; E2E selectors partially out-of-date.
5. **Seed/schema consistency risk:**
   - Seed script includes notes indicating schema/database mismatch scenarios.

---

## 9) Rewrite Inputs (for ctf planning)

Before implementing ctf LightHouse, lock these decisions:

1. Canonical schema source of truth (shared schema vs SQL migration artifacts).
2. Blocks scope for v1:
   - implement route/UI support, or
   - explicitly defer with documented contract boundary.
3. Profile deletion semantics for host-linked properties/matches under FK constraints.
4. Test strategy baseline (contract-level API tests and stable E2E selectors).
