# SocketRelay Plugin Feature Inventory (Legacy Reference)

## Scope

- Source analyzed (reference-only): `platform/`
- Rewrite target: `ctf/`
- Plugin name to retain: `SocketRelay`
- Guardrail honored: no edits in `platform/`

---

## Executive Summary

`SocketRelay` is a request-and-fulfillment plugin with:

- authenticated profile CRUD,
- request lifecycle management,
- fulfillment claiming and closure,
- in-context chat messaging,
- public shareable request browse/detail views,
- admin moderation and announcements.

It includes anti-scraping/rate-limit controls on public routes. Legacy implementation also contains schema and privacy mismatches that should be addressed in ctf rewrite.

## 4) Data Model and Storage Behaviors

Evidence:

- `platform/shared/schema/socketrelay/index.ts`
- `platform/server/storage/plugins/socketrelay-storage.ts`
- `platform/schema.sql`

Core entities:

1. `socketrelay_profiles`
2. `socketrelay_requests`
3. `socketrelay_fulfillments`
4. `socketrelay_messages`
5. `socketrelay_announcements`

Storage-level behaviors:

1. Request expiration and repost support.
2. Fulfillment creation and close status transitions.
3. Access-scoped message retrieval by fulfillment.
4. Profile delete workflow includes anonymization-oriented behavior in storage layer.

---

## 5) Security and Policy Controls

Evidence:

- `platform/server/routes/socketrelay.routes.ts`
- `platform/server/dataObfuscation.ts`
- `platform/server/rateLimiter.ts`

Implemented controls:

1. Auth guards for private user routes.
2. Admin guards for admin routes.
3. CSRF checks on admin write routes.
4. Public anti-scraping delays and rotation on public list routes.
5. Public route rate limiters: listing and item-level.

---

## 6) Routing and UI Surface

Evidence:

- `platform/client/src/routes/plugin-routes.tsx`
- `platform/client/src/routes/public-routes.tsx`

Protected routes:

1. `/apps/socketrelay`
2. `/apps/socketrelay/profile`
3. `/apps/socketrelay/announcements`
4. `/apps/socketrelay/chat/:id`
5. `/apps/socketrelay/admin`
6. `/apps/socketrelay/admin/announcements`

Public routes:

1. `/apps/socketrelay/public`
2. `/apps/socketrelay/public/:id`

---

## 7) Test and Seed Coverage Signals

Evidence:

- `platform/test/api/socketrelay.test.ts`
- `platform/test/e2e/socketrelay.spec.ts`
- `platform/test/client/pages/socketrelay/profile.test.tsx`
- `platform/scripts/seedSocketRelay.ts`

Observed:

1. API and E2E test files exist.
2. Many API tests are mock/request-shape assertions, not full handler integration.
3. E2E coverage includes skip-heavy auth assumptions and selector fragility risks.
4. Seed script contains rich scenario data including mixed public/private requests and fulfillment chat messages.

---

## 8) Gaps, Ambiguities, and Migration Risks

1. **Schema drift across sources (blocker risk):**
   - `socketrelay_profiles` differs between Drizzle schema, SQL, and seed payload assumptions (e.g., `displayName` usage).
2. **Public privacy projection mismatch:**
   - Public API payload contains `firstName` and `lastName`, while UI policy is first-name-only rendering.
3. **Cross-module boundary bleed:**
   - Directory announcement routes are implemented inside `socketrelay.routes.ts`, increasing module ownership ambiguity.
4. **Tests are partially scaffold-level:**
   - A meaningful subset of API/E2E tests validate mock shape instead of robust route/storage behavior.
5. **CSRF policy consistency ambiguity:**
   - Admin writes are protected, but broader mutation-CSRF expectations should be explicitly defined in ctf contracts.

---

## 9) Rewrite Inputs (for ctf planning)

Before implementing ctf SocketRelay, lock these decisions:

1. Canonical schema source of truth across shared schema, SQL migrations, and seed payloads.
2. Public response DTO privacy contract (field-level projection).
3. Module ownership boundaries (SocketRelay-only routes vs cross-plugin route placement).
4. Test strategy uplift from mock-shape assertions to contract/integration confidence.
5. CSRF policy baseline for state-changing endpoints.
