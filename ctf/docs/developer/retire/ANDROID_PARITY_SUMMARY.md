What is implemented

- For the listed plugins, a lightweight client-side mock UI was added so Android builds and QA can exercise UI flows without requiring backend services.
- Parity checklist files were updated to reflect implemented client-side behaviors where applicable.

What remains

- Backend-dependent features: stream-backed token flows, public projection routes, admin governance endpoints, server-side validation and guards, and Play Store release steps remain manual tasks and are documented in the individual plugin parity checklists.
- Any feature requiring secret keys, Play Store credentials, or backend token services cannot be completed autonomously and is documented accordingly.

Next steps (autonomous)

- Continue scanning feature inventories and implement additional client-side mocks where missing.
- Open targeted PRs for any remaining plugins that lack client-side mocks.
- Run lint/typecheck/build and smoke tests and update parity checklists and PRs with testing notes.
- Monitor PRs and merge when approved.

If you need specific plugins prioritized, approve their PRs from mobile and I will merge and continue. Otherwise, I will continue through inventories in order.
