# Directory Mini-App Feature Inventory (Legacy Reference)

## Scope
- **Source analyzed (reference-only):** `platform/`
- **Rewrite target:** `ctf/`
- **Mini-app name to retain:** `Directory`
- **Write boundary observed:** no edits in `platform/` (per `.claude/rules/index.mdc` and `099-agent-scope-guardrails.mdc`)

---

## Executive Summary
`Directory` is a profile-and-discovery mini-app for skill exchange. It supports:
- authenticated profile CRUD,
- public profile discovery,
- admin management for unclaimed/claimed profiles,
- announcement publishing,
- privacy and anti-scraping controls,
- shared skills taxonomy integration (skills/sectors/job titles),
- profile geocoding and coordinate backfill tooling.

This document lists **all discovered implemented features** from legacy code and labels migration ambiguities that should be resolved before ctf rewrite.

## 7) Route and UI Inventory

### 7.1 Authenticated UI Routes
Evidence: `platform/client/src/routes/mini-app-routes.tsx`
- `/apps/directory`
- `/apps/directory/profile`
- `/apps/directory/announcements`
- `/apps/directory/admin`
- `/apps/directory/admin/announcements`

---

## 8) Test Evidence for Implemented Behaviors

Evidence:
- `platform/test/api/directory.test.ts`
- `platform/test/e2e/directory.spec.ts`
- `platform/test/client/pages/directory/profile.test.tsx`
- `platform/guides/TESTING.md`

Covered/indicated behaviors:
1. Profile CRUD intent and route coverage scaffolding.
2. Public endpoint privacy/rate-limit expectations.
3. Admin profile list expectations for claimed/unclaimed first-name handling.
4. E2E path coverage for profile, dashboard, public listing, admin path.
5. Testing guide includes Directory privacy toggle acceptance criteria.

---

## 9) Ambiguities and Migration Risks to Resolve in ctf Rewrite

1. **Schema SQL inconsistency**
   - `platform/schema.sql` shows malformed `state VARCHAR(50,` and appears out-of-sync.
   - Source of truth should be normalized for ctf migration.

2. **Seed payload mismatch**
   - `platform/scripts/seedDirectory.ts` uses `nickname` and `displayNameType` fields not present in `shared/schema/directory/index.ts`.
   - Decide whether these are legacy leftovers or intended model additions.

3. **Announcement route placement**
   - Directory announcement endpoints are implemented inside `socketrelay.routes.ts`.
   - For ctf rewrite, place Directory endpoints in Directory-specific route/module boundaries.

4. **Admin delete semantics for skills**
   - UI note states deletion will not remove skills from existing profiles.
   - Confirm desired ctf behavior: reference integrity constraints, soft-delete taxonomy, or historical label retention.

5. **Public vs authenticated data exposure contract**
   - Authenticated list includes fields hidden from public views (e.g., Signal behavior differs by page).
   - Define explicit contract/spec in ctf command schema to avoid drift.

6. **Test reliability / selector drift**
   - Some legacy tests appear scaffold-like and may not align with current selectors exactly.
   - ctf rewrite should define authoritative test IDs and update tests accordingly.

---

## 10) Rewrite Boundary Guidance (for ctf)

Per `.claude/rules/index.mdc`:
1. Keep `Directory` as mini-app-first flow with shared contracts and web/mobile parity.
2. Treat `platform/` behavior as reference baseline, not direct copy target.
3. Re-implement with explicit command/policy contracts under ctf architecture.
4. Preserve core functional parity:
   - profile CRUD + visibility,
   - public listing/profile views,
   - admin unclaimed workflow + assignment,
   - announcements,
   - anti-scraping and rate limiting,
   - skills/sectors/job title selector model,
   - geocoding and coordinate support.
