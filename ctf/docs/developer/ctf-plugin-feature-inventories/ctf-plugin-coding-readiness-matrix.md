# CTF Plugin Coding Readiness Matrix

This matrix tracks coding-readiness status across CTF feature inventories and applies Rule 114 and Rule 120 governance decisions.

## Governance Decisions Applied

- Non-plugin inventory is Rule 120 exempt and is not a blocker for plugin coding readiness.
- Planned state is acceptable pre-implementation.
- Command/access/audit YAML contracts are required before PR merge/release, not before coding start.
- Rule 114 profile/deletion contract is required for all plugins before coding start.

## Release-Gate Backlog

Plugins still missing command/access/audit YAML triplets (required before PR merge/release):

- `announcements`
- `directory`
- `feed`
- `gentlepulse`
- `lighthouse`
- `mood`
- `socketrelay`
- `trusttransport`
- `workforce`

## Change Log

- 2026-02-25: Created initial coding readiness matrix with Rule 114 baseline and release-gate backlog.
