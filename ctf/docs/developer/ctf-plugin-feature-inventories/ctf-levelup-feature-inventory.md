# LevelUp Plugin Feature Inventory (CTF Rewrite)

## Scope and Boundary

- Rewrite target only: `ctf/`
- Legacy reference excluded from implementation: `platform/`
- Plugin name: `LevelUp`
- Plugin slug: `levelup`

## Implemented User Features

1. Cohort listing with filters for `track`, `status`, and `startDate`.
2. Cohort detail view with curriculum, milestones, and enrollment affordance.
3. Enrollment flow with optional deposit policy and escrow split per milestone.
4. User dashboard with wallet balance, LevelUp escrow totals, active enrollments, and recent transactions.
5. Dispute open flow with comments and attachment metadata support.

## Implemented Trainer Features

1. Milestone validation endpoint for trainer/admin.
2. Milestone release endpoint that settles learner escrow and trainer payout split.
3. Trainer dashboard with cohorts, pending validations, trainees, and payout ledger summary.

## Implemented Admin Features

1. Admin credit adjustment endpoint (`mint`/`adjustment` path).
2. Dispute resolution endpoint with optional adjustment transfer.
3. Admin panel with KPI placeholders (enrollments, completions, time-to-first-billable-hour placeholder).

## API Surface and Route Map

- `GET /api/levelup/cohorts`
- `POST /api/levelup/cohorts`
- `POST /api/levelup/enroll`
- `POST /api/levelup/milestones/[milestoneId]/validate`
- `POST /api/levelup/milestones/[milestoneId]/release`
- `POST /api/levelup/transfers`
- `POST /api/levelup/disputes`
- `POST /api/levelup/disputes/[disputeId]/resolve`
- `POST /api/levelup/admin/adjust-credits`

## Data Model and Storage Contracts

Primary migration: `ctf/migrations/2026-03-24-levelup-core-phase3.sql`

Core tables:

1. `levelup_cohorts`
2. `levelup_curriculum_items`
3. `levelup_milestones`
4. `levelup_enrollments`
5. `levelup_enrollment_milestone_escrows`
6. `levelup_milestone_validations`
7. `levelup_disbursements`
8. `levelup_stipend_schedules`
9. `levelup_disputes`
10. `levelup_dispute_comments`
11. `levelup_rate_limit_counters`
12. `levelup_command_idempotency`
13. `levelup_audit_events`
14. `levelup_policy_config`

External value movement dependencies:

- `service_credits_wallets`
- `service_credits_transfers`
- `service_credits_escrow_holds`
- `service_credits_governance_events`
- `service_credits_dispute_adjustments`

## Security and Compliance Controls

1. Server-side role and access checks (`admin`, `trainer`, `user`) via plugin access gate.
2. CSRF checks enforced on mutation endpoints.
3. Input validation via `zod` on all LevelUp routes.
4. Command idempotency persistence for mutation replay safety.
5. Audit events for all implemented LevelUp commands.
6. Enrollment and milestone validate rate-limit counters persisted in DB.

## Seed Coverage Status

Deterministic seed script added:

- `ctf/scripts/seedLevelupPhase3.mjs`

Seed content:

1. 5 users by deterministic IDs (1 admin, 1 trainer, 3 trainees).
2. Trainees set to 500 ServiceCredits each.
3. Open cohort with required credits 300, milestones (30/70), and baseline payout/refund policy JSON.

## Gaps, Ambiguities, and Technical Debt

1. Automated test suites are intentionally deferred for MVP (Rule 118).
2. Android parity implementation is not included in this web-first pass; follow-up parity ticket required before GA.
3. KPI fields in admin panel remain placeholders pending analytics contract finalization.
4. Dispute attachment storage uses URL metadata only; secure storage integration remains a follow-up.

## Change Log

- 2026-03-24: Initial LevelUp phase-3 implementation inventory created (schema, repository, API routes, shell components, seed script, contracts).
