# Chyme Plugin Feature Inventory (CTF Rewrite)

## Scope and Boundary

- Rewrite target only: `ctf/`
- Legacy `platform/` remains reference-only and must not be modified.
- Unified plugin scope slug: `chyme`
- This document captures the implemented Chyme scope in `ctf/` as of the current rewrite baseline.

## Intent and Outcome

Chyme delivers a lightweight social-audio room with companion text chat, shared-adapter Stream-backed room join flow, provider-neutral access enforcement, and plugin-scoped deletion behavior under the CTF plugin-first architecture.

Lifecycle/governance references applied:

1. Inventory/checklist lifecycle follows `index.mdc` precedence and Rule 120.
2. Profile/deletion boundaries follow Rule 114 and `ctf/docs/contracts/CHYME_PROFILE_AND_DELETION_CONTRACT.md`.
3. Implementation sequencing must honor baseline phase order: auth integration, Railway deployment baseline, Vercel integration, Expo baseline.

## Target User Features (Implementation Scope)

1. Authenticated room bootstrap via `GET /api/chyme/room` with deterministic room provisioning (`chyme-main-room`) and participant upsert.
2. Companion text chat read/send via `GET /api/chyme/messages` and `POST /api/chyme/messages`, with DB persistence and Stream message fan-out through shared adapters.
3. Stream-backed room join/token flow via `POST /api/chyme/join`, using shared Stream wrappers in `packages/shared`.
4. Service-scoped deletion request via `DELETE /api/account/chyme-profile`.
5. Full-account deletion request initiation via `DELETE /api/account/full-account`, including Service Credits reclaim dependency queueing in existing reclaim/outbox tables.
6. Web UI surface includes participant list, join-call action, chat panel, and deletion actions.
7. Android UI surface includes room summary, participant roster, chat send/read, join action, and deletion actions using runtime-configured provider-neutral identity headers.

## Target Admin Features

1. No Chyme-specific admin UI is required for MVP unless called by contracts/checklist updates.
2. Eligibility gate must enforce shared access approval model (`approved user` or `admin`) for room/chat/join routes.

## API Surface and Route Map (Target)

Chyme plugin routes:

- `GET /api/chyme/room`
- `GET /api/chyme/messages`
- `POST /api/chyme/messages`
- `POST /api/chyme/join`

Deletion/account routes used by Chyme UI:

- `DELETE /api/account/chyme-profile`
- `DELETE /api/account/full-account`

Current command-contract note:

- Chyme should be delivered as route + repository flows aligned to plugin command/access/audit contracts.
- Plugin command/access/audit YAML triplet artifacts are present:
  - `ctf/docs/contracts/CHYME_PLUGIN_COMMAND_CONTRACTS.yaml`
  - `ctf/docs/contracts/CHYME_PLUGIN_ACCESS_POLICY_CONTRACTS.yaml`
  - `ctf/docs/contracts/CHYME_PLUGIN_AUDIT_CONTRACTS.yaml`

## Data Model and Storage Contracts (Target)

Canonical schema target: Chyme core tables are defined in `ctf/schema.sql`, aligned to route assumptions and schema-drift checks.

1. `chyme_rooms`
   - Shared room metadata (`service_name='chyme'`, `call_active`).
2. `chyme_service_profiles`
   - Plugin extension lifecycle per user (`active|deleted`, timestamps).
3. `chyme_room_members`
   - Membership roster keyed by `(room_id, user_id)`, role enum (`speaker|listener`), last-seen updates.
4. `chyme_messages`
   - Message history with DB-level text constraint (`1..1000` chars).
5. `chyme_deletion_events`
   - Service/account deletion event log.
6. `service_credits_account_deletion_reclaims`
   - Downstream reclaim dependency record created when full-account deletion is requested.
7. `service_credits_adapter_outbox`
   - Queue used to hand the reclaim dependency to the existing Service Credits execution flow.

## Security, Privacy, and Compliance Controls (Target)

1. Authenticated access is required on Chyme routes; unauthenticated requests are denied (`401`).
2. Access gate enforces approved-user or admin eligibility (`403` for non-approved non-admin users).
3. Identity handle source is the canonical auth-provider username/handle for username/`@mention` semantics, aligned to `ctf/docs/contracts/PLUGIN_IDENTITY_HANDLE_BASELINE.md`.
4. Message payloads are trimmed server-side and rejected when empty.
5. Service deletion runs in transaction and records deletion event for audit trail.
6. Full-account endpoint records the Chyme deletion request and queues the downstream Service Credits reclaim dependency.
7. Stream integration is routed through shared wrappers/adapters in `ctf/packages/shared`.

## Web and Android Delivery Status

1. Web implementation is delivered for room/chat/join/deletion workflows.
2. Android implementation is delivered for room/chat/join/deletion workflows using runtime-configured request identity and the same protected API surface.
3. Current parity status is **web+android complete**.

## Seed Coverage Status

Rule requirement: deterministic plugin seed script for manual validation in dev environments.

Current status:

- Deterministic Chyme seed script is present under `ctf/scripts/seedChymePhase0.mjs`.
- Validation and release evidence live in `ctf/docs/testing/CHYME_FIRST_TEST_PASS.md` and `ctf/docs/quota-impact/2026-04-05-chyme-phase0-remediation.md`.

## Risks, Ambiguities, and Known Technical Debt

1. Full-account delete lifecycle remains request-first; terminal orchestrator completion still depends on the broader account-deletion workflow.
2. Chyme-specific admin tooling and moderation controls are out of MVP unless explicitly approved.
3. Chyme uses Stream chat channels for room coordination and token issuance; a dedicated in-room native call client remains a future enhancement if the product moves beyond the current token/join pattern.

## Delivery Phasing

1. Phase 0 — Core implementation completed: room/chat/join/deletion routes and persistence with policy and audit enforcement.
2. Phase 0b — Deterministic dev/test readiness completed: seed script and release evidence wired to canonical docs.
3. Phase 1 — Android parity completed: mobile parity uses the same policy outcomes and protected API surface.
4. Phase 2+ — Lifecycle closure remains open only for global full-account orchestrator completion beyond `requested` state.

## Change Log

- 2026-02-25: Created initial Chyme CTF rewrite inventory and documented governance/parity requirements.
- 2026-02-25: Added Chyme command/access/audit YAML triplet references and removed contract-triplet gap from known technical debt.
- 2026-03-01: Reframed inventory for fresh-start implementation sequencing and removed implemented-baseline assumptions.
- 2026-03-01: Added canonical auth-provider handle decision for Chyme/plugin identity parity.
- 2026-04-05: Re-audited auth boundaries so Chyme depends on provider-neutral auth context and generic server identity policy rather than Clerk-specific assumptions.
- 2026-03-01: Recorded Phase 0 delivery status (API + policy + audit + migration + deterministic seed) and Android deferment details.
- 2026-03-02: Closed Chyme second-pass scaffold gap by persisting room call-active state on join and publishing dedicated closure handoff evidence.
- 2026-04-05: Completed Android parity on the real Chyme API surface, queued Service Credits reclaim dependency on full-account delete, and aligned Chyme docs to `ctf/schema.sql` plus shared Stream wrappers.
