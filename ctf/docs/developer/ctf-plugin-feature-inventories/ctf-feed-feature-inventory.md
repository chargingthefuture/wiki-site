# Feed Plugin Feature Inventory (CTF Rewrite)

## Scope

- Rewrite target only: `ctf/`
- Legacy reference excluded from implementation: `platform/`
- Plugin name: `Feed`
- Central admin surface decision: `/admin/feed-announcements`
- Delivery decision: web-first launch with full Android parity required before release.
- Feed is a three-channel surface: Announcements, Questions (LLM-assisted Q&A), and Community Support.
- All commands use the unified `feed.*` namespace.

## Intent and Outcome

Feed is the survivor-facing timeline and discovery surface combining community activity, announcements, LLM-assisted Q&A, and peer support into a unified three-channel experience.

Approved architecture decisions:

1. Source-of-truth for persisted feed/announcement/question/community objects is PostgreSQL.
2. Stream (GetStream) is used for fan-out and timeline delivery behavior, not canonical storage.
3. Admin operations for Feed + Announcements are centralized at `/admin/feed-announcements`.
4. Web-first implementation is approved, with full Android parity required before release.
5. LLM-assisted Q&A uses approved data sources only; inference logs are audited.
6. All command contracts use the unified `feed.*` namespace (no separate `announcements.*` namespace).

## 1) Planned User-Facing Features

### 1.1 Feed Timeline Core (Unified)

1. Paginated timeline of feed items across all three channels with deterministic ordering.
2. Channel filter controls: all, announcements, questions, community.
3. Plugin-scoped activity and announcement visibility filters.
4. Empty/error/loading states with accessible fallback messaging.

### 1.2 Channel: Announcements

1. Announcement items render in-feed using shared card contract.
2. Priority and expiry windows influence rank/visibility.
3. Optional toast rendering mode is configurable under Feed display controls.

### 1.3 Channel: Questions (LLM-Assisted Q&A)

1. Users submit natural-language questions (e.g., "Find me housing within 10 miles of 90210").
2. Questions are categorized (housing, services, general, safety, benefits) with optional location context.
3. LLM-generated answers are produced from approved data sources with confidence score and source attribution.
4. Community members can also reply to questions with peer answers.
5. Users can rate answers (helpful, not helpful, flagged) for quality feedback loop.

### 1.4 Channel: Community Support

1. Community support posts for peer-to-peer engagement (general, peer support, resource sharing, events).
2. Threaded replies on community posts.
3. Content moderation and rate limiting on post creation.

### 1.5 Membership-Aware Personalization

1. Membership changes trigger visibility recalculation.
2. Membership event stream is used for fan-out invalidation/update workflows.
3. Non-member and member experiences remain policy-compliant and auditable.

### 1.6 Interaction and Read-State

1. Mark-read / unread tracking per user and item.
2. Dismiss/hide actions for non-mandatory announcements.
3. Link-out behavior with safe redirect and telemetry.

---

## 2) Planned Admin Features

### 2.1 Central Admin Surface

1. Single admin page at `/admin/feed-announcements` for Feed + Announcements controls.
2. Role-gated create/edit/publish/archive actions.
3. Moderation and publish-state controls with auditability.

### 2.2 Feed Rendering Controls

1. Global rendering-mode configuration (card-only, card+toast where allowed).
2. Channel enable/disable controls.
3. Priority and targeting rules management.
4. Preview/simulation mode before publish.

### 2.3 Governance and Operational Visibility

1. Change history and actor attribution for admin mutations.
2. Quota-impact awareness for Stream fan-out heavy changes.
3. Feature flag and kill-switch controls.
4. LLM inference monitoring: model ID, confidence, source attribution, quality ratings.

## 3) API Surface and Route Map

### 3.1 Plugin Command Surface (Authoritative — Unified `feed.*` Namespace)

All command contracts must conform to templates from:

- `.github/instructions/201-plugin-command-schema-template.mdc`
- `.github/instructions/202-plugin-access-policy-schema-template.mdc`
- `.github/instructions/203-plugin-audit-schema-template.mdc`

**Timeline (unified):**

1. `feed.timeline.fetch` (v2.0.0 — supports channel filter)
2. `feed.item.read.mark`
3. `feed.item.dismiss`

**Announcements:** 4. `feed.announcement.draft.create` 5. `feed.announcement.draft.update` 6. `feed.announcement.publish` 7. `feed.announcement.archive` 8. `feed.announcement.read.mark` 9. `feed.announcement.dismiss` 10. `feed.announcement.render-mode.update` 11. `feed.announcement.targeting.validate`

**Questions (LLM-assisted Q&A):** 12. `feed.question.submit` 13. `feed.question.answer.generate` 14. `feed.question.answer.rate`

**Community Support:** 15. `feed.community.post.create` 16. `feed.community.post.reply`

**Admin / Governance:** 17. `feed.admin.config.update` 18. `feed.membership.event.emit`

### 3.2 HTTP Projection Routes

User routes:

- `GET /api/feed/items` (supports `?channel=` filter)
- `POST /api/feed/items/:itemId/read`
- `POST /api/feed/items/:itemId/dismiss`
- `GET /api/feed/config`
- `POST /api/feed/questions`
- `POST /api/feed/questions/:questionId/answer`
- `POST /api/feed/answers/:answerId/rate`
- `POST /api/feed/community/posts`
- `POST /api/feed/community/posts/:postId/reply`

Admin routes:

- `GET /api/feed/admin/config`
- `PUT /api/feed/admin/config`
- `POST /api/feed/admin/announcements`
- `PUT /api/feed/admin/announcements/:announcementId`
- `POST /api/feed/admin/announcements/:announcementId/publish`
- `POST /api/feed/admin/announcements/:announcementId/archive`

---

## 4) Data Model and Storage Contracts

### 4.1 Canonical Profile and Plugin Extension

Must follow single-profile rule:

1. Reuse canonical user profile for identity and baseline preferences.
2. Plugin extension data is keyed by `user_id` only.
3. No duplicate full profile table for Feed.

Planned extension entity:

- `feed_user_extension`
  - `user_id`
  - feed preference flags,
  - read-state settings,
  - toast rendering preference where permitted.

### 4.2 Domain Entities

Planned domain tables:

**Existing (implemented):**

1. `feed_items`
2. `feed_item_targets`
3. `feed_user_read_state`
4. `feed_user_dismissals`
5. `feed_render_config`
6. `feed_membership_events`
7. `feed_admin_audit_trail`
8. `announcements`
9. `announcement_revisions`
10. `announcement_delivery_events`
11. `announcement_user_state`
12. `announcement_membership_events`

**New (required for Q&A and community channels):** 13. `feed_questions` 14. `feed_answers` 15. `feed_answer_ratings` 16. `llm_inference_log` 17. `feed_community_posts` 18. `feed_community_replies`

### 4.3 Source-of-Truth and Fan-Out

1. PostgreSQL stores canonical feed, announcement, question, and community metadata.
2. Stream receives projected fan-out payloads after DB commit success.
3. Retries/idempotency ensure at-least-once fan-out without duplicate canonical writes.

---

## 5) Security, Privacy, and Compliance Controls

1. Server-side authorization on all user/admin commands.
2. Role and consent checks enforced by command access policy contracts.
3. CSRF protection for all state-changing web routes.
4. Audit logging for allow/deny and publish/archive transitions.
5. Sensitive payload redaction in logs and diagnostics.
6. LLM inference inputs are sanitized; outputs are logged with model ID and confidence for audit.
7. Content moderation on question/community post submission (rate limiting + policy violation checks).
8. Plugin-scoped deletion + full-account deletion contracts aligned to template in `ctf/docs/templates/PLUGIN_PROFILE_AND_DELETION_CONTRACT_TEMPLATE.md`.

---

## 6) Web and Android Delivery Plan

1. Web-first release is approved for initial CTF rewrite delivery.
2. Full Android parity is required before release sign-off.
3. Android implementation covers all three channels: announcements, questions, community.
4. Android parity note: `ctf/docs/developer/ctf-plugin-feature-inventories/ctf-feed-android-parity-note.md`.

---

## 7) Quota-Impact and Operational Budget Notes

1. Any change increasing Stream fan-out volume must include a quota-impact note.
2. Quota notes must follow `ctf/docs/quota-impact/TEMPLATE.md`.
3. Checklist evidence must include expected monthly impact and degradation plan.
4. LLM inference costs must be tracked separately and budget-gated.

---

## 8) Seed Coverage Status

Seed script requirement: Provide a deterministic plugin seed script with dummy development data for manual plugin validation in dev environments. Must include:

- Feed items across all three channels
- Sample questions with LLM-generated and community answers
- Sample community posts with replies
- Membership events, read/dismiss states

---

## 9) Schema Drift and Predeployment Expectations

1. Predeployment requires schema drift check between migration SQL, ORM/schema definitions, and API contracts.
2. Any drift acceptance must be explicit and documented with mitigation.
3. PR evidence must include migration replay/rollback proof and drift-check output.

---

## 10) Gaps, Ambiguities, and Known Technical Debt (Current)

- Questions channel: schema, API routes, repository, and UI pending implementation.
- Community channel: schema, API routes, repository, and UI pending implementation.
- LLM inference integration: provider selection, model configuration, and inference pipeline pending.
- Android implementation: full parity pending across all three channels.
- Separate `ANNOUNCEMENTS_PLUGIN_*_CONTRACTS.yaml` files are deprecated; all contracts now live in unified `FEED_PLUGIN_*_CONTRACTS.yaml`.

---
