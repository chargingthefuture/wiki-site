# Announcements Plugin Feature Inventory (CTF Rewrite)

## Scope

- Rewrite target only: `ctf/`
- Legacy reference excluded from implementation: `platform/`
- Plugin name: `Announcements`
- Admin control location: `/admin/feed-announcements`
- Delivery policy: web-first with Android follow-up ticket requirement.

## Intent and Outcome

Announcements provides trusted, policy-compliant broadcast messaging to target survivor audiences and renders into Feed experiences.

Approved architecture decisions:

1. PostgreSQL is canonical source-of-truth for announcement lifecycle state.
2. Stream is used for fan-out and delivery projection after canonical persistence.
3. Admin workflow is centralized at `/admin/feed-announcements`.
4. Web-first release is approved; Android follow-up ticket is required.

Approved suggestions incorporated:

1. Standardize naming to **Announcements** in current docs/contracts.
2. Keep legacy typo alias note for compatibility where old naming appears.
3. Use plugin membership event stream to recalculate audience eligibility when membership changes.
4. Allow optional toast rendering mode controlled by Feed configuration, not standalone announcement-only UI mode.

## 1) Planned User-Facing Features

### 1.1 Announcement Delivery and Rendering

1. In-feed announcement cards with clear state and metadata.
2. Priority, schedule, and expiry-aware visibility handling.
3. Optional toast presentation through Feed rendering controls.

### 1.2 Audience Targeting Outcomes

1. Role/plugin-membership-targeted visibility.
2. Region and policy-scoped audience constraints.
3. Membership change events trigger recalculation and fan-out updates.

### 1.3 Interaction and Acknowledgement

1. Read/acknowledged status tracking where required.
2. Dismiss behavior for non-mandatory notices.
3. Link actions and safe external navigation policies.

---

## 2) Planned Admin Features

### 2.1 Authoring and Publishing

1. Draft, schedule, publish, archive lifecycle management.
2. Targeting controls (segment, role, plugin membership, region).
3. Priority and expiry configuration.

### 2.2 Governance and Review

1. Role-gated approvals for publish/archive operations.
2. Full audit trail for content and targeting mutations.
3. Preview simulation of resulting audience/visibility.

### 2.3 Unified Feed + Announcements Ops

1. Operated from `/admin/feed-announcements`.
2. Coordinated controls with Feed rendering settings.
3. Shared kill-switch/feature-flag and degradation behavior.

## 3) API Surface and Route Map (Planned)

### 3.1 Plugin Command Surface (Authoritative)

All command contracts must conform to templates from:

- `.claude/rules/201-plugin-command-schema-template.mdc`
- `.claude/rules/202-plugin-access-policy-schema-template.mdc`
- `.claude/rules/203-plugin-audit-schema-template.mdc`

Planned command groups:

1. `announcements.draft.create`
2. `announcements.draft.update`
3. `announcements.publish`
4. `announcements.archive`
5. `announcements.read.mark`
6. `announcements.dismiss`
7. `announcements.targeting.validate`
8. `announcements.membership.event.emit`

### 3.2 HTTP Projection Routes (Planned)

User routes:

- `GET /api/announcements`
- `POST /api/announcements/:announcementId/read`
- `POST /api/announcements/:announcementId/dismiss`

Admin routes:

- `POST /api/announcements/admin/drafts`
- `PUT /api/announcements/admin/drafts/:draftId`
- `POST /api/announcements/admin/:announcementId/publish`
- `POST /api/announcements/admin/:announcementId/archive`
- `POST /api/announcements/admin/targeting/validate`

---

## 4) Data Model and Storage Contracts (Planned)

### 4.1 Canonical Profile and Plugin Extension

Must follow single-profile rule:

1. Reuse canonical user profile fields.
2. Keep plugin extension fields linked by `user_id`.
3. No duplicate full profile table.

Planned extension entity:

- `announcements_user_extension`
  - `user_id`
  - acknowledgement preferences,
  - delivery preference flags,
  - mute/dismiss policy preferences where permitted.

### 4.2 Domain Entities

Planned domain tables (initial set):

1. `announcements`
2. `announcement_revisions`
3. `announcement_targets`
4. `announcement_delivery_events`
5. `announcement_user_state`
6. `announcement_membership_events`
7. `announcement_admin_audit_trail`

### 4.3 Source-of-Truth and Fan-Out

1. Persist canonical announcement state in PostgreSQL first.
2. Project to Stream fan-out layer only after successful DB transaction.
3. Maintain idempotent projection and replay safety.

---

## 5) Security, Privacy, and Compliance Controls (Planned)

1. Server-side role and consent checks for all publish/mutate operations.
2. Deny-by-default access for cross-tenant/cross-region reads.
3. CSRF and input validation on state-changing web endpoints.
4. Allow/deny audit events for command execution and admin actions.
5. Redaction policy for sensitive operational logs.
6. Deletion and retention behavior aligned with `ctf/docs/templates/PLUGIN_PROFILE_AND_DELETION_CONTRACT_TEMPLATE.md`.

---

## 6) Web and Android Delivery Plan (Approved)

1. Web-first implementation is approved for CTF rewrite.
2. Android follow-up ticket is mandatory evidence for deferred parity.
3. Critical compliance and visibility semantics must remain consistent across platforms.

---

## 7) Quota-Impact and Stream Budget Notes

1. Targeting/fan-out changes require a stream quota-impact note.
2. Quota-impact notes must use `ctf/docs/quota-impact/TEMPLATE.md`.
3. Deployment PR must link quota note when fan-out volume changes.

---

## 8) Seed Coverage Status (Planned)

Seed script requirement: Provide a deterministic plugin seed script with dummy development data for manual plugin validation in dev environments.

---

## 9) Schema Drift and Predeployment Expectations

1. Predeployment requires schema drift checks across migration SQL, application schema, and API contracts.
2. Any accepted drift must include explicit rationale and rollback path.
3. PR evidence must include migration replay + rollback verification and drift-check output.

---

## 10) Change Log

- 2026-02-24: Created initial CTF rewrite Announcements inventory with approved centralized admin surface, web-first delivery policy, Postgres source-of-truth + Stream fan-out architecture, naming normalization/legacy alias guidance, quota-impact gates, and schema drift predeployment evidence requirements.
