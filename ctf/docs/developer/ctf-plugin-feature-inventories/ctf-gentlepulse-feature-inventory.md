# GentlePulse Plugin Feature Inventory (CTF Rewrite)

## Scope and Boundary

- Rewrite target only: `ctf/`
- Legacy `platform/` is reference-only and must not be modified.
- Unified plugin scope slug: `gentlepulse`
- This document is a planning inventory for CTF rewrite parity.
- Plugin name to retain: `GentlePulse`.

Scope decisions locked for this rewrite:

1. `Settings and Personalization` is moved to app-level non-plugin ownership.
2. GentlePulse has no in-app admin page in CTF.
3. GentlePulse plugin announcements are removed from plugin scope and owned by app-wide Announcements/Feed surfaces.
4. GentlePulse API posture is authenticated-user-only.
5. Dedicated progress endpoints are out of scope; legacy references are treated as stub/scaffold mismatch.

Authoritative app-level ownership reference:

## 1) Planned User Features

### 1.1 Library Dashboard

1. Plugin route for meditation library (`/apps/gentlepulse`).
2. Meditation listing with pagination (`limit`, `offset`).
3. Sort modes: `newest`, `most-rated`, `highest-rating`.
4. Tag-based filtering.
5. Favorites-only mode with deterministic loading/empty/error states.

### 1.2 Meditation Card Interactions

1. Display title, description, tags, duration, average rating, and rating count.
2. Play action increments server play count and opens meditation media URL.
3. Authenticated star rating submission (1–5) with aggregate refresh.
4. Authenticated favorite add/remove interactions with cache refresh and user feedback.

### 1.3 Support Page

1. Support/About route (`/apps/gentlepulse/support`).
2. Trauma-informed plugin description.
3. Privacy statement aligned to current CTF policy language.

## 2) Planned Admin Features

### 2.1 In-App Admin Surface

1. No in-app GentlePulse admin UI in CTF scope.
2. No plugin-admin web/mobile route parity is required for GentlePulse in this rewrite.
3. Operational CRUD management is externalized and out of CTF code implementation scope.

## 3) Planned API Surface and Route Map

### 3.1 Plugin Command Surface (Planned)

1. `gentlepulse.library.list`
2. `gentlepulse.meditation.detail.fetch`
3. `gentlepulse.meditation.play.record`
4. `gentlepulse.rating.upsert`
5. `gentlepulse.rating.summary.fetch`
6. `gentlepulse.favorite.add`
7. `gentlepulse.favorite.remove`
8. `gentlepulse.favorite.list`
9. `gentlepulse.favorite.status.fetch`

### 3.2 HTTP Projection Routes (Planned)

User routes (authenticated):

- `GET /api/gentlepulse/meditations`
- `GET /api/gentlepulse/meditations/:id`
- `POST /api/gentlepulse/meditations/:id/play`
- `POST /api/gentlepulse/ratings`
- `GET /api/gentlepulse/meditations/:id/ratings`
- `POST /api/gentlepulse/favorites`
- `DELETE /api/gentlepulse/favorites/:meditationId`
- `GET /api/gentlepulse/favorites`
- `GET /api/gentlepulse/favorites/check`

Excluded route groups:

1. No `/api/gentlepulse/admin/*` routes in CTF rewrite scope.
2. No plugin-scoped announcements routes in CTF rewrite scope.
3. No `/api/gentlepulse/progress*` routes in CTF rewrite scope.

## 4) Planned Data Model and Storage Contracts

### 4.1 Meditations

1. Meditations store title, description, media URL, thumbnail, duration, tags, position, active state.
2. Aggregate fields retained: `playCount`, `averageRating`, `ratingCount`.

### 4.2 Ratings

1. Ratings keyed per user + meditation in authenticated model.
2. Rating writes validate integer range `1..5`.
3. Aggregate rating/count recomputed after mutation.

### 4.3 Favorites

1. Favorites keyed per user + meditation.
2. Favorite add/remove/list/status endpoints support deterministic interface-state hydration.

## 5) Planned Security, Privacy, and Compliance Controls

1. Auth required for all GentlePulse API routes.
2. Server-side authz and validation on every mutation.
3. Data minimization for logs and diagnostics.
4. No plugin-local settings persistence logic in GentlePulse; app-level settings contract is reused.

## 6) Web and Android Parity Plan

1. Core library/filter/sort/favorite/rating/play behaviors must match between web and Android.
2. No GentlePulse admin parity obligations in web/mobile for this rewrite scope.
3. App-level settings parity is tracked in non-plugin inventory.

## 7) Seed Coverage Status (Planned)

Seed script requirement: Provide a deterministic plugin seed script with dummy development data for manual plugin validation in dev environments.

## 8) Gaps, Ambiguities, and Known Debt (Planning)

1. Migration path from legacy anonymous `clientId` model to authenticated user model requires explicit cutover/backfill plan.
2. Media playback provider behavior and telemetry contracts require final lock for parity acceptance.

## 9) Change Log

- 2026-02-25: Created initial GentlePulse CTF rewrite inventory with locked scope decisions: app-level settings ownership, no in-app admin surface, no plugin announcements scope, authenticated API posture, and no dedicated progress endpoint scope.
- 2026-02-25: Removed Mood integration from GentlePulse parity scope; GentlePulse and Mood are documented as separate plugins.
