# CTF Plugin Agent Task Briefs (Copy-Paste Prompts)

Date: 2026-03-01

Use these prompts to dispatch background agents.

Dispatch note:

- This repository is a fresh-start rewrite from boilerplate. Do not assume prior plugin implementation exists unless explicitly stated in a prompt.
- Baseline foundation prompts are mandatory before broad plugin parallelization.
- Required baseline order: auth integration → Railway deployment baseline → Vercel deployment integration → Expo deployment baseline.
- Mandatory for every prompt in this document: before implementation, the agent must ask clarifying questions until requirements are unambiguous, wait for answers, and then proceed.
- Mandatory for every prompt in this document: scaffold-only output is not acceptable; agent must either deliver completion-grade implementation evidence or provide an explicit blocked-by list with owner and date.
- Completion-status reconciliation rule: before marking any phase complete, verify both handoff docs and assignment matrix status are aligned; if they differ, mark as "needs reconciliation" and resolve before next dispatch.

- Do not stop at scaffold code; complete implementation or provide explicit blocked-by owner/date.
- Keep non-financial metric scope.
