# CTF Plugin Background-Agent Assignment Matrix

Date: 2026-03-01

This matrix is designed for dispatching background coding agents using the dependency order in `ctf-plugin-implementation-order.md`.

## Handoff artifact contract (applies to every agent)

Each agent handoff should include:

1. Contracts updated (command/access/audit YAML, or explicit release-gate note if deferred).
2. Migration + schema drift evidence for changed entities.
3. API routes implemented with policy checks and deny taxonomy.
4. Web + Android parity note (delivered/deferred with owner/date).
5. Seed data updates and validation notes.
6. ~~Test evidence summary (unit/integration/manual checklist references).~~ [DEFERRED FOR MVP — see Rule 118.]

## Phase mapping (aligned with task briefs)

- **Phase -1A to -1D (mandatory baseline pass 1):** `agent-bf-01-clerk-foundation`, `agent-bf-02-railway-baseline`, `agent-bf-03-vercel-integration`, `agent-bf-04-expo-baseline`
- **Phase -1E to -1H (mandatory baseline pass 2):** `agent-bf-01-clerk-foundation-v2`, `agent-bf-02-railway-baseline-v2`, `agent-bf-03-vercel-integration-v2`, `agent-bf-04-expo-baseline-v2`
- **Phase 0 (start after baseline):** `agent-00-chyme-core`, `agent-01-taxonomy-core`, `agent-02-directory-core`, `agent-03-feed-announcements`
- **Phase 1 (dependency-gated):** `agent-04-workforce`, `agent-05-skills-hunt`, `agent-06-foundation`
- **Phase 2 (parallel after Phase 0 completion):** `agent-07-lighthouse`, `agent-08-socketrelay`, `agent-09-trusttransport`, `agent-10-peer-programming`, `agent-11-mood`, `agent-12-gentlepulse`, `agent-13-weekly-performance`
- **Phase 3 (stabilization/finance lock):** `agent-14-gdp`, `agent-15-service-credits`

## Coordination checkpoints

1. **Checkpoint BF (end Phase -1):** Lock baseline auth + deployment assumptions for Clerk, Railway, Vercel, and Expo.
2. **Checkpoint A (end Phase 0):** Lock and publish stable consumer contracts for Chyme, Taxonomy, Directory, and Feed/Announcements.
3. **Checkpoint B (mid Phase 1):** Verify downstream adapters (Workforce, Skills Hunt, Foundation) against frozen upstream contracts.
4. **Checkpoint C (Phase 2 ongoing):** Run shared deny-taxonomy and parity drift checks across independent plugin teams.
5. **Checkpoint D (Phase 3):** Validate finance/accounting semantics between GDP and Service Credits before release-candidate cut.

## Dispatch notes

- If you need fewer agents, merge `agent-11-mood` + `agent-12-gentlepulse` and merge `agent-14-gdp` + `agent-15-service-credits`.
- If you need faster throughput, split `agent-03-feed-announcements` into two agents only after shared admin-surface contract lock is merged.
- Do not dispatch Phase 0+ plugin prompts before the full baseline sequence (Phase -1 pass 1 and pass 2) completes.
- Dispatch policy for every agent: require clarify-first Q&A until requirements are unambiguous, and reject scaffold-only handoffs.

## Dispatch status tracker

Update this table as you launch and receive handoffs.

Status legend:

- `Not started` — not yet dispatched.
- `Dispatched` — prompt sent; waiting for first progress signal.
- `In progress` — active implementation underway.
- `Blocked` — cannot continue without dependency/decision/input.
- `Done` — handoff received and accepted.
