## Agent Communication Rules (always apply)

Canonical source: [`chargingthefuture/chargingthefuture` → `.github/instructions/098-agent-communication-rules.mdc`](https://github.com/chargingthefuture/chargingthefuture/blob/main/.github/instructions/098-agent-communication-rules.mdc). Full rules reproduced here since that file lives in another repo.

### Mandatory
- Communicate as a robot/system agent, not a human. Do not use TL;DR, etc.
- Be maximally concise; eliminate every non-essential word.
- Avoid all pleasantries, greetings, and human-like courtesies.
- Provide direct facts and actions only; no hedging or qualifiers.
- Use structured formats (lists, tables, code blocks) instead of prose.
- Omit explanatory preamble; lead with actionable information.

### Response Structure
- Lead with facts, not context-setting.
- Use line breaks for visual separation instead of verbose transitions.
- Combine related information into single messages; avoid multi-step back-and-forth unless necessary.

### Text Formatting
- Minimize bold text. Applies to both chat responses and any `.md` (or other) files agents create or edit.
- Do not bold for emphasis, do not bold every list-item label, and do not bold whole sentences. Bold has no logical value when overused; it adds visual noise without adding information.
- Acceptable bold use is rare and structural only: e.g. a single table header or a one-word inline label where the surrounding document already uses that convention. When in doubt, do not bold.
- Prefer plain prose, lists, headings, and tables to carry structure instead of bold.

### Prohibited
- Verbose explanations of obvious operations.
- Unnecessary elaboration on what the agent is about to do ("I will now...", "I'm going to...").
- Multiple introductory sentences before the actual content.
- Filler comments or padding.

### Information Density Priority
- Max substantive content per message.
- Min transitional or explanatory language.
- Facts before context.
- Structured data before narrative summary.

### Excluded Vocabulary

| Do not use | Use instead | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| punch list | list | Jargon; unclear meaning. |
| stale | deprecated | "Stale" is consistently misused; "deprecated" is the intended meaning. |

## Architecture (publishing pipeline)

- Content source of truth: GitHub Wiki repo `chargingthefuture.wiki.git` (submodule at `wiki/`). Blog fetches wiki markdown live at render time — editing a wiki page updates the site without a rebuild.
- Article registry: `wiki-site/content-index.yaml` (canonical). Synced into `wiki-site/artifacts/wiki/src/lib/articles.ts` via `pnpm wiki:sync`. A post appears on the blog only after a `content-index.yaml` entry exists, is synced, committed, and pushed.
- Deploy: push to `main` touching `wiki-site/**` → `.github/workflows/deploy-wiki-gh-pages.yml` builds and deploys to GitHub Pages at base path `/chargingthefuture/`.
- CI (no publish): `.github/workflows/wiki-validate.yml` on `main` pushes and PRs.

## Commands (run from `wiki-site/`)

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `pnpm wiki:validate` | Validate `content-index.yaml` |
| `pnpm wiki:sync` | Regenerate `articles.ts` from the index |
| `pnpm wiki:sync:dry` | Preview sync changes |
| `pnpm wiki:preview` | Local dev server (http://localhost:5000) |
| `pnpm wiki:build` | Build (base `/`) |
| `pnpm wiki:build:pages` | GitHub Pages build (base `/chargingthefuture/` + 404.html) |

## Git Branch and PR Naming (always apply)

- Branch names **must be descriptive** — never use auto-generated or random identifiers (e.g. `claude/gifted-archimedes-oHMEA`).
- Use the pattern `<type>/<short-description>`, e.g. `fix/blog-dates-et-label`, `feat/category-filter`, `ci/submodule-checkout`.
- PR titles must match: concise, action-oriented, no random strings.
- If a branch was created with a bad name, rename it before opening the PR: create a new descriptive branch from the same commits, open the PR from that, close the old one, delete the old branch.
